# Contributing to mytake.org

We welcome contributions of all kinds - design, code, strategy, anything you got!

We believe in permissionless innovation - if you have an idea, feel free to just build it and submit a PR.

We also believe in teamwork and consensus - if you want your idea to get merged and released, be ready to debate its merits in the PR.

To minimize wasted effort, it might be a good idea to discuss your plan in an issue before you get started, but don't be afraid to just tinker and toss a prototype out there.
