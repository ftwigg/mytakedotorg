# Name and title design

## Fundamental principles

1. We should strive for everyone's name to have the same format.
2. When a person changes their name or has a nickname, we should strive to use the name under which they prefer to be known.  If they have written a book, the name they use as an author is appropriate.
3. Event titles should not depend on the outcome.
    + e.g. If a debate's title is based on who eventually won the presidency, what do we title a debate for a content which hasn't been decided yet?

## Presidential debate titles

To make sure that titles don't depend on the outcome, we will list the candidate's names alphabetically.

## Names with some judgement required

### 1960

- Sander Vanocur (moderator of 1960-09-26) was born Alexander Vinocur. [(wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sander_Vanocur)
- Bob Fleming's full name is [Robert H Fleming](https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/06/obituaries/robert-h-fleming-72-a-johnson-press-aide.html), but he is referred to as "Bob" in the debate, so we will call him "Bob H Fleming" to avoid confusion.

### 1976

- James Earl Carter is much better known as Jimmy Carter.  All his books are under the name Jimmy Carter, so we'll say "Jimmy E Carter".
