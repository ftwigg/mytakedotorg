# MyTake.org is a Work in Progress

What you currently see on MyTake.org is a prototype of MyTake.org's potential. Here is what you need to know in order to use this prototype.

## Reading a Take

From the MyTake.org homepage you can click on excerpts to read various sample Takes we've put together for you. While reading a Take you'll notice Facts that stand out from the rest of the text in the form of either a video or a block of some highlighted text. 

### Videos

Press play on a video to see a clip that the Take auther has prepared for you. The video will start and stop automatically where the author has specified. If you prefer to see the context surrounding the prepared clip, you are free to do so using the video controls. You can see the entire video from start to finish if you wish.

### Documents

Click on a block of highlighted text to see the author's highlights in full context of the document's original source.

## Reading a Document's Original Source

If parts of the document are highlighted and you wish to use these highlights to support your own Take then click the highlighted portions of text to send them to a new Take in which you can say anything you wish.

If you don't see any highlights then feel free to highlight any portion of the document that you'd like. After the text is highlighted, click it to send it to a new Take.

At any time you can clear the highlights on the document by clicking the "Clear Selection" button at the top of the page.

If you are currently writing a Take, then the Fact that you send to your Take will be inserted where your cursor was most recently located within the Take.

## Exploring the Foundation Timeline

The Timeline is the way to discover new Facts to add to your Take. Click and drag the Timeline from side to side to see Facts from different times. Click a Fact to a see the full document or video. 

### Exploring a Document

Follow the steps in the section above, 'Reading a Document's Original Source', to highlight and give your Take on portions of Documents.

### Exploring a Video

Use the standard YouTube controls to browse videos. If you wish to give your Take on a clip from a video then take the following steps:

 1. Pause the video where you want your clip to begin.
 2. Press the "Set Start Time" button.
 3. Pause the video where you want your clip to end.
 4. Press the "Set End Time" button.
 5. Press the "Send to Take" button to give your Take on the clip you created.

If you are currently writing a Take, then the Fact that you send to your Take will be inserted where your cursor was most recently located within the Take.

## Writing a Take

Use the text editor to type anything you wish next to Facts you've sent to your Take. If you wish to add additional Facts to your Take, explore the Timeline that's located at the bottom of the page and follow the instructions in the section above, "Exploring the Foundation Timeline" for adding new Facts to your Take. Some important points to note:

 1. Your Take cannot be saved yet. If you want to keep it, take a screenshot of it.
 2. As soon as you navigate your browser to a new page, your Take will be lost.
 3. We'd be happy to see screenshots of Takes you've written if you're willing to share with us.
